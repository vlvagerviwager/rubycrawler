* = done

  *Return first link in a page (a href tag)
  *Return all links in a page, add to index (txt file > csv > SQLite database / string)
  *Check all links to see if they were crawled
  *If not, crawl and add links to index
  *Search for a term in the index, return links containing term 
  Simple interface: get user input through console - i.e. URL and search term
  Loosen coupling
  Rails web app (interface)
